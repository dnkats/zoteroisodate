JavaScript for [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) to change the date format to YYYY-MM-DD in all selected referencies. 

### How do I get set up? ###

* Copy the script `zotero_date.js` to `Tools/Developer/Run_JavaScript` into the `Code` window.
* Add month names if needed (look for `var months` and `findIndex`), currently the script understands English and German months.
* For test runs activate the line after `ACTIVATE FOR TEST RUNS` and comment out the next line.
* Select the referencies in the main zotero window and press `Run`.
